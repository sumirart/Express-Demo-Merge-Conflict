# Express-Demo-Merge-Conflict
This repo is to demo about git merge conflict.

### What is Git Merge Conflict:
- Is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits
(https://blog.axosoft.com/learn-git-merge-conflict/)
- When all the changes in code occur on different lines or different files, git will successfully merge commits 
- But when there are conflicting changes on the same line, merge conflict occurs because git doesn't know which code to keep and to discard
